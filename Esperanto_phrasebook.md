# Esperanto phrasebook

<!-- Banner -->

The famous constructed language (Esperanto)[https://en.wikipedia.org/Esperanto] first appeared in Russian Poland in 1887, the product of a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist and amateur linguist, Dr. Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof. Dr. Zamenhof hoped that the worldwide adoption of a neutral international language would ease ethnic tensions and enable people of widely differing backgrounds to communicate with each other. The name of the language means "one who hopes." Esperanto is not officially aligned with any particular country or ethnic group; indeed, one can find Esperanto speakers in well over 100 countries around the world. [http://pasportaservo.org/](Pasporta Servo), a hospitality service for Esperanto speakers, includes more than 1,300 addresses in almost ninety different countries.

Speakers are most numerous in Europe and East Asia, especially in cities. Esperanto is particularly prevalent in the northern and central countries of Europe; in China, Korea, Japan, and Iran within Asia in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico in the Americas; and in Togo in Africa. There is an online, user-maintained directory of Esperanto speakers and their locations on a world map at https://esperantujo.directory/.

## Pronunciation guide

Esperanto uses twenty-eight letters from the Roman alphabet. Its spelling is phonetic, each sound has a single letter and each letter represents a single sound, with no exceptions. The letters Q, W, X, and Y are not used. Five of the letters have a circumflex on top of them (ĉ ĝ ĥ ĵ ŝ) and one has a breve (ŭ). Esperanto speakers represent these letters in situations where the circumflex cannot be used (e.g. unformatted e-mail where only basic ASCII characters can be used) either by placing an "x" after the letter; placing an "h" after the letter (this is the method approved by Esperanto's creator, Dr. Zamenhof); or placing the circumflex itself (^) after the letter. On the Internet, most Esperantists use the "x" method, so that ĉ ĝ ĥ ĵ ŝ ŭ would be cx gx hx jx sx ux.

Words are always pronounced with the accent on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable.
